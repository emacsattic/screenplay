Tab completion for sluglines and character name insertion
has been blown away for some reason.  M-p and arrow keys do cycle
through the appropriate list.

Editing functions need to be called at end of line of each
block or line spacing and formatting go wacky.

Printing from the buffer or from a saved screenplay file
probably won't have appropriate left margin or page line
length w/o extra processing.  The Unix command pr can be
used here.

Completion, scene and character display histories are lost
between sessions.  Session state saving is forthcoming.

Parenthetical remarks are not yet handled.
